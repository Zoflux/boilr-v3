          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
          
          <p className="italic mb-3">In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-3">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-3">
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>

            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">

                <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
          
          <p className="italic mb-3">In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-3">We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
          
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
            <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honour this Privacy Notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Partners.</strong> We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

          <p className="mb-4">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
          
          <p className="italic mb-3">In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
          
          <p className="italic mb-3">In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Switzerland), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making.

          <p className="mb-4">If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-4"><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
          
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Account Information</h3>

          <p className="mb-6">If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at felix@avaylnow.com.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
          
          <p className="mb-6">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
          
          <p className="italic mb-3">In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date at the top of this Privacy Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
